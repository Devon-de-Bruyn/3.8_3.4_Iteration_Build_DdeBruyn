							As the CEO of Moosic, I am responsible for running all facets of the business.
I have a proven executive management track record and over 20 years of experience driving sales
growth in the music industry. Prior to founding Moosic, I was Chief Marketing Officer and
Executive Vice President of Sales for Loudcloud, Inc, responsible for all global sales and marketing
activities. At Loudcloud I led the transformation into an enterprise-focused company while growing sales
50% year over year. Previously, I served as Chief Marketing Officer of NorthPoint Communications,
where she led the design and implementation of all sales and marketing strategies. I also served as
President of Blockbuster, Inc.'s e-commerce division and was recognized by Internet World as one of the
Top 25 'Click and Mortar' executives in the country in June of 2000. I spent the prior 15 years at IBM,
holding several domestic and international executive positions. I served on the board of directors of
Arbitron, Inc. and the Forum for male Entrepreneurs and Executives. I earned a BS degree at the
University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School of Business. <br><br>Moosic is a digital music, podcast, and video service that gives you access to millions of songs and other content from creators all over the world.
